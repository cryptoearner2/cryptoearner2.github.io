TAO Finance

TAO Finance is a decentralized financial system on the Ethereum Network.  
It consists of a stable currency TAO$ for deposits, investment funds and loans.  
Stability is maintained by soft pegging the TAO$ to the US$.  The supply of TAO$ increases with its market growth.  
In the development stages TAO$ will be available in liquidity pools on Balancer and Uniswap and direct purchase.  

The TAO Finance key differentiator is the Oracle driven TAOBot which receives buy and sell signals for the investment vault.   
ERC20 coins and tokens are purchased and sold based on their market performance.  
The hold time of an asset is market and algorithm determined.  

In summary, the TAO$ features democratic governance, a stable monetary model, an investment strategy, redeemability,
and the immutability and pseudo anonymity of blockchain storage.
