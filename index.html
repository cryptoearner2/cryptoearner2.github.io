    <b>New project UPDATE - TAO.MONEY <BR> NewsFlash - we lowered the price of TAO$ to $.05USD in the Ethereum Balancer TAO$/USDC pool.  Great time to buy in 
       as we stabilize to $1USD.  Also, Balancer is giving you a transaction fee credit in BAL </b><br><br>

       <b>Congratulations to AVAX/TAO$ Liquidity Providers who received A 10% of total value bonus</b><br><br>
      <b>Next Liquidity provider bonus (12%) for all holders in the AVAX/TAO$ Pool is June 15</b><br><br>
     <b>ATTENTION TAO$ holders:  You will receive TAOX governance tokens when TAO$ is stabilized at 1USD </h1></center>

<p>TAO Finance is a decentralized financial system on the Ethereum and Avalanche Network. 
It consists of a stable currency TAO$ pegged to USD for deposits, liquidity pools and loans. 
TAOX will be distributed to liquidity providers and depositors in the future with value determined by market.
The TAO$ App is being developed for Android and iPhone and browser. <br><br>
  
  We are now developing on the AVALANCHE C-BLOCKCHAIN.  Low transaction costs and the ETH-AVX Bridge allows us to leverage both chains.<br><br>
  
  We already have a liquidity pool of AVAX / TAO$ on AVALANCHE which can be accessed using the Pangolin app with Metamask.  
  If TAO$ doesn't appear in coin list here's the contract 0xeB4E507a250F99B00a9EC0677156B250Ae719EAA <br><br>
  This a great time to add liquidity or swap for TAO$ because we are growing the pool and gradually stabilizing the TAO$ = 1 USD$.   
  When that is achieved the market driven governance token will be issued and TAO$ holders will receive a share. <br> <br>

  If you are doing transactions you'll need some AVAX for gas which you can get on many exchanges like KUCOIN and BINANCE. 
  Be careful, some exchanges offer AVAX purchase but no way to withdraw to Avalanche.

  The AVALANCHE Wallet https://wallet.avax.network/  can be used to receive that to the X-CHAIN and transfer it to C-CHAIN Metamask.<br><br>
  
  
  Here's how to connect Metamask to Avalanche.<br></p>
