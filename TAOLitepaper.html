<p class=MsoNormal><b>TAO Finance</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TAO Finance is a decentralized financial system on the Ethereum and Avalanche Network. 
It consists of an algorithmic stable currency TAO$ pegged to USD for deposits, liquidity pools and loans.
The liquidity pool AVAX/TAO$ is on the Avalanche Network. We are currently growing this pool and will stabilize 
it at 1 TAO$ = 1 USD using a ReserveMonetaryPolicyBot running in the cloud.

The gTAO governance token will be distributed to liquidity providers when the pool is stabilized and pegged.
The gTao token value is market driven.
	
The bTAO token is issued to borrowers and is tranmutable for 1 bTAO = 1 TAO$ or exchanged on any available market.
	
The TAO$ App is being developed for Android and iPhone and browser. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The supply of TAO$ increases with its market growth to maintain its peg to USD.  
In the development stages TAO$ will be available in liquidity pools on Ethereum-Balancer USDT/TAO$,
the Avalanche-Pangolin AVAX/TAO$ pool  and direct purchase.  
</p>
	
<p class=MsoNormal>Funds in the deposit vault receive interest and may be used as collateral for loans. 
</p>	

<p class=MsoNormal>A TAO Finance key differentiator is the Oracle driven TAOBot which receives buy and sell signals for the investment vault.   
ERC20 coins and tokens are purchased and sold based on their market performance.  
The hold time of an asset is market and algorithm determined.  
Depositors in the investment vault receive profit sharing dividends.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In summary, the TAO$ features democratic governance, a stable monetary model, an investment strategy,
redeemability, and the immutability and pseudo anonymity of blockchain storage.
